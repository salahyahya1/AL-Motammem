      <p class="mt-2 text-sm sm:text-base leading-7 text-slate-700">
        Our primary goal in collecting user information is to enhance your experience on our website. We achieve this goal by, among other things, providing interactive communications such as our electronic newsletters to the e-mail address that you provide to us, and developing future editorial content based on your interests. To develop content targeted to your interests, we use aggregated user information to determine which areas of our website users prefer based upon traffic to those areas. We do not track what individual users read, but instead how well each page or content area performs overall.

        Microtech could derive some benefits and/or revenue from advertising. In order to attract and retain advertisers we use the aggregated, anonymous information that we gather (as well as information from third-party market researchers) to describe our services to partners and to assist our advertisers and sponsors to better understand our audience. We do not disclose personally identifying information about our users to these parties.

These parties, as well as advertisers who contract directly with a third-party service to serve their advertisements, may set their own cookies.
